# Interactive and Evolutionary Algorithms

#### Description
This is repository for evolutionary algorithms and interactive evolutionary algorithms

#### Software Architecture
This software is programmed with JDK 1.8, which is popular in programmers that the later version. It also can run well in the later Java version environment.

#### Installation

1.  Ensure Java environment is ready.
2.  Ensure Excel with extension ".xlsx" file can be open, in which the experiments data are stored.

#### Instructions

1.  By running this software, three ways you can select. 
- Run the program from the entrance.Main. This way provide a GUI to set parameters and start the evolution.
- Run the program from the entrance.MainCmdRuning. This way provide a cmd style running and you must setup the parameters in the fold  _resources/Controlparameters.conf_
- Run the program from tools.xChart.MyRealtimeChart01 in a visualization style, by which one can read the process of your evolutionary algorithm as shown below.
